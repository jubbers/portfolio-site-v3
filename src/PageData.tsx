  description: <p>Draft Bot is a handy Discord Bot to help you with your <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering'>Magic: The Gathering</a> needs in an easy-to-access place. Look up cards, check their prices, or even start a 'sealed' draft with friends anywhere on the planet! <br/><br/> Super lightweight containerized NodeJS Server running on an old laptop in my laundry room using AWS <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/kms/'>KMS</a> and <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/'>DynamoDB</a> for data storage.</p>

  description: <p>Dino land is a DOM-based clicker game. Collect as many dinosaurs as you can as fast as possible. Imagine cookie clicker, but it's dinosaurs so its <em>way</em> cooler. <br/><br/>The whole project is pure HTML, CSS, & JS. No frameworks, package managers, or anything else was used in the projects development.</p>

  title: "Egg",
  description: <p>Egg is a cute, quick 2D platformer about finding friends in the middle of a strange, unknown land. I did gameplay dev, tools dev, art, and art pipeline management. <br/><br/> It's written in pure C#, bootstrapping from <a href='https://monogame.net/'>MonoGame</a> as a sprite renderer. Everything else was hand-spun by myself and my team.</p>

  description: <p>Changeling is a beautiful and heartbreaking upcoming VR title from RIT's Frameless Labs and the studio Xena Ad Hoc about a family dealing with loss and grief. <br/><br/> I was the founding lead engineer on the project, working on gameplay, systems, VFX, and tools. The game is made in <a href='https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US'>UE4</a> but the repo isn't public, so just imagine really good C++ code and spaghetti blueprints.</p>

  description: <p>Ever wanted a pokedex that's worse than <a href='https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page'>Bulbapedia</a>, more saturated than an actual rainbow, and only gives you access to info about the first 151 Pokemon? Well it looks like <em>I</em> made the website for <em>you!</em> <br/><br/> This is a super old HTML/CSS/JS project. Nothing fancy, just a barebones site for learning. </p>
